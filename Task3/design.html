        <h3 class="intro1">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br>were current, if not more so, in the company I joned. I<br>honestly feel I got every penny's worth. </h3>
        <h4 class="text1">"I was an EMT for many years before I joned the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a<br>transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for<br>the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12<br>weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course,I've<br>successfully switched careers, workingas a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</h4>

        <h3 class="intro3">Such a life-changing<br>experience. Highly<br>recommended!</h3>
        <h4 class="text3">"Before joining the boocamp,I've<br>never written a line of code. I needed<br>some structure from professionals<br>who can help me learn programming<br>
                            step by step. I was encouraged to<br>enroll by a former student oh theirs<br>who can only say wonderfull things<br>about the program.
                            The entire<br>curriculum and staff did not<br>disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> end I never had to waight long for<br>
                            assistance. The agile team project, in<br>particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in away<br> that no tutorial
                            could ever have. In<br>fact, I've often referred to it during<br>interviews as an example of my<br>developent experience. It certainly<br>
                            helped me land as a job as full-stack<br>developer after receiving multiple<br>offers. 100% recommend!"</h4>

        <h3 class="intro5">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp<br>themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from<br>their experiences was easy.</h3>
        <h4 class="text5">"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress wich I find really refreshing. The<br>
            program gave me the confidents necessary to be able to go out in the world and present<br>myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
            You will get the<br>personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people."</h4>
